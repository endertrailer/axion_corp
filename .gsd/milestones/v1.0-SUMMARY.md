# Milestone Audit: v1.0

**Audited:** 2026-02-27

## Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases | 7 |
| Gap closures | 2 |
| Technical debt items | 1 |

## Must-Haves Status
| Requirement | Verified | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Predictive Backend Modeling | ✅ | Embedded SQL averaging inside `main.go:forecastPriceTrend` |
| Sync Frontend Payload with AI | ✅ | `api_service.dart` strictly types `MarketOption` and `price_trend_pct` variants |
| Asynchronous Data Framework | ✅ | Ground-truthed `ingestion.go` cron instances spanning Weather and data.gov arrays |
| Localized TTS Audio UX | ✅ | `flutter_tts` controls instantiated natively mapping `why_hi` and `why_mr` dynamically generated by Gemini-1.5-Flash |
| Hyper-local Verification Loop | ✅ | WhatsApp Webhooks mapped directly over PosgreSQL `crowdsource_reports` structs with 24-hr sliding validation overriding logic |

## Concerns
- The `goimports` utility dependency is fundamentally lacking from the Docker Go Container restricting IDE lint pipeline enforcement.
- WhatsApp Webhook parses farmer feedback based solely on `<market> <crop> <number>`. This regex could easily false-fire without proper parameter validation inside the Text body.

## Recommendations
1. Secure a dedicated Indian regional WhatsApp Provider API key to bridge the `POST` interface seamlessly out of testing domains.
2. Implement stricter Regex filtering alongside SMS-OTP boundaries to limit Sybil attack spoofing on the `crowdsource_reports` table (e.g validating the reporting `From` phone maps reliably to an active `farmer_id` stored inside PosgreSQL).

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Implement Offline SMS/USSD fallback logic (Deferred during Phase 3 due to native Flutter `SharedPreferences` caching precedence).
