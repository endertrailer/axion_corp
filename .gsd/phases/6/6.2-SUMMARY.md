# Plan 6.2 Summary

## Tasks Completed
- **TTS Package Integration**: Executed `flutter pub add flutter_tts` within `frontend/`. 
- **Audio-First Core Logic**: Bootstrapped the global `FlutterTts` entity inside `_DashboardScreenState`. Configured `setSpeechRate`, `setPitch`, and dynamic `setLanguage` blocks mapped functionally to the farmer's stored language preference string (`en-IN`, `hi-IN`, `mr-IN`).
- **Interactive UI Render**: Embedded an `IconButton` wrapped alongside the "Why are we suggesting this?" header on the UI Expansion Tile. Controlled by an `isSpeaking` boolean state, providing a robust, visible entry point to audio accessibility.

## Verification Evidence
- Modified `api_service.dart` to unmarshal `why_hi` and `why_mr` dynamically. 
- Dispatched `flutter build apk --debug`. Front-end compilation passes without any syntax or dependency breakages.
