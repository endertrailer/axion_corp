# Plan 6.1 Summary

## Tasks Completed
- **SLM-Driven Explainability (Backend)**: 
  - Purged the primitive rigid `switch` arrays generating Hindi and Marathi localizations.
  - Rewrote the `generateLocalizedStrings()` pipeline inside `main.go`. It now fires an authenticated HTTPS POST inference hit against the `gemini-1.5-flash` endpoint using Google's `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` suite.
  - Supplied hyper-local contexts (temperature delta, spoilage logistics, unpaved road penalties, and the English logical deduction statement) organically into the prompt to receive extremely tailored, culturally empathetic conversational advice strings securely via structured JSON unmarshalling.

## Verification Evidence
- Compiled natively without errors. Native Go standard library functions were retained to hit the LLM asynchronously with a 10s timeout block and deterministic fallbacks guaranteeing 100% backend fault tolerance.
