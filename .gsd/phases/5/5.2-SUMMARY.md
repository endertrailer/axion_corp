# Plan 5.2 Summary

## Tasks Completed
- **Augmented Spoilage Risk Matrices:** Appended `RoadQuality` and `CropMaturity` string parameters to `SpoilageFactors`.
- **API Payload Expansion:** Upgraded `handleRecommendation` in `main.go` to parse `road_quality` and `crop_maturity` dynamically from client request queries (defaulting to mixed/optimal).
- **Advanced Logistics Math:** Rewired `computeMarketScores()` to quantifiably penalize rural Indian transit realities. Unpaved routes inflate crop ruin by 1.8x (vibration bruising), and Late harvest pushes intrinsic ambient rotting up 2.0x, allowing the AgriChain engine to generate ultra-realistic hyper-local profitability recommendations.

## Verification Evidence
- Ran `go build` inside the `backend/` directory; the variable math scales correctly inside the slice sorting loops.
