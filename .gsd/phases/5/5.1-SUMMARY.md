# Plan 5.1 Summary

## Tasks Completed
- **Transition Forecasting to Real PostGIS Data**: 
  - Purged the pseudo-random `simulateHistoricalData()` array generator out of `models.go`.
  - Migrated `forecastPriceTrend()` logic natively to linear regression algorithms mapped explicitly across true Postgres integer ranges fetched via `fetchHistoricalPrices()`.
  - Upgraded `calculateVolumeTrend()` to measure price suppression/rises natively over recent `[]float64` time boxes spanning prior periods, determining Volume Gluts/Shortages autonomously based on raw price momentum rather than hallucinated volume parameters.

## Verification Evidence
- Ran `go build` inside the `backend/` directory; the database-coupled regression slices compiled correctly without structural errors.
