## Phase 5 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] Swapped `simulateHistoricalData` for dynamic PostGIS `[]float64` price arrays inside `forecastPriceTrend` and `calculateVolumeTrend` — VERIFIED (`main.go` logic rewritten to use real Postgres history)
- [x] Spoilage mathematics scales transit ruin (+1.8x) for unpaved roads and temp decay (+2.0x) for late-stage maturity crops. — VERIFIED (Wired dynamically into `computeMarketScores` and parsed from `c.Query` API hooks)

### Verdict: PASS
