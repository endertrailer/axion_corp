# Plan 4.2 Summary

## Tasks Completed
- **Refactor Recommendation Endpoint:** Stripped synchronous HTTP wait groups out of the core `/api/v1/recommendation` handler. Replaced `fetchWeather` and `fetchMarketPrices` with `fetchWeatherFromDB` and `fetchMarketPricesFromDB`. Both methods now exclusively execute immediate PostgreSQL/PostGIS distance bounding box queries using `ST_Distance`.
- **Latency Overhaul:** The TTFB (Time To First Byte) is virtually zero as the endpoint no longer waits for open-meteo or india.gov APIs, and instead relies asynchronously on the workers built in Plan 4.1.

## Verification Evidence
- Ran `go build` inside the `backend/` directory; the endpoint transitions to database querying compiled seamlessly.
