# Plan 4.1 Summary

## Tasks Completed
- **Init PostgreSQL + PostGIS Schema:** Created `schema.sql` defining `mandis`, `daily_prices`, and `weather_cache`. Configured `db.go` to connect and optionally apply this file on startup.
- **Build Async Ingestion Workers:** Wrote `ingestion.go` which loops on standard Go tickers. It automatically fetches Open-Meteo and data.gov.in API outputs, mapping them into the PostGIS tables natively using `ON CONFLICT` merge sets. Linked these into `main.go`.

## Verification Evidence
- Ran `go build` inside the `backend/` directory; the new asynchronous routines and DB connections compiled cleanly without errors.
