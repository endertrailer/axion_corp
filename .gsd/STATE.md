## Last Session Summary
Phase 10 (Dynamic Crop Theming) finalized successfully. The application completely shed its static green UI and now dynamically infers its `themeColor` based upon the active `CropItem`. This robust architectural change modifies the `ChatDialog`, `CropPickerScreen`, and root `Scaffold` simultaneously. Every single element (Buttons, Gradients, ActionChips) updates fluidly to represent the selected crop accurately.
