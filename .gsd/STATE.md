## Current Position
- **Phase**: 5 (completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary
Phase 5 executed successfully. Purged all hardcoded heuristics generating price/volume analytics. Rewrote the core Engine struct `computeMarketScores` to forecast profitability margins using true statistical linear regression mapped over real `daily_prices` cached in PostgreSQL. We also expanded `SpoilageFactors` taking into account the realities of rural transit environments (unpaved vibration damage and crop maturity states) for authentic trust.

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Phase 6 (SLM Explainability & Audio-UX)
