## Last Session Summary
Phase 9 (UI Polish & Modernization) finalized successfully. The Flutter frontend was stripped of its flat `Colors` and injected with bright, contrasting `LinearGradients`. The `Dashboard` and `ChatDialog` feel much more elevated through the usage of strong drop shadows, high `BorderRadii` cards, and glassmorphism tinted containers.
