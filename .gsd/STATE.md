## Last Session Summary
Phase 6 (Dynamic Crop Selection) finalized successfully. 1 plan completed migrating the hardcoded `_cropId` backend fallback script into a dynamic multi-variable mapping list, and tying it to a realtime Flutter Dropdown AppBar widget.

## Next Steps
1. The developer can verify the multi-crop switching ability instantaneously in the existing Android Emulator session.
2. Finalize any further Milestone enhancements or move into Phase 7 structural enhancements.
